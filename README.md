## About the Game

In this game, the user finds themselves on a deserted island. By gathering specific materials on the island and engaging in exchange with shops, they enhance their own level. Consequently, they can upgrade their boat to move to the next island. They also eliminate enemies present on the island. Upon defeating the main enemy, the character gains upgrades.
